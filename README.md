# qexle Web development

I will post templates, tutorials and practice projects here. It's nice giving back and helping others and if you want to do the same then hop on discord and spiceworks with the rest of us. Now if you have any questions or requests for tutorials and what not, then send me a mail at help@qexle.on.spiceworks.com.

Feel free to download and edit my codes, use anything you find here for whatever projects you'd like...<br />
It's always nice if you give me some credit of some sort though :)
