# Practice 1

In this practice project you will be making a landing page for a Nike shoe(Nike Blazer Mid '77 Vintage: https://www.nike.com/no/t/blazer-mid-77-vintage-herresko-CBDjT0/BQ6806-100).

<hr />

Here is a few requirements for this project:

1. Only use the colors provided:

```
Charcoal - hsl(197,37%,24%)
Persian green - hsl(173,58%,39%)
Orange yellow crayola - hsl(43,74%,66%)
Sandy brown - hsl(27,87%,67%)
Burnt sienna - hsl(12,76%,61%)
Jet - hsl(0,0%,20%)
Light gray - hsl(0,0%,80%)
Platinum - hsl(0,0%,90%)
White - hsl(0,0%,100%)
```

    Its important to have high contrast(if someone have bad screens, bad lighting, sunlight on screen etc..).
    It can be helpful to decide what should be the primary color, and the primary accent color, secondary color and secondary accent color and so on. This way of setting colors will be helpful later when you learn about variables.

2. Margins and paddings

```
4px
12px
24px
48px
92px
128px
256px
512px
```

    By giving the elements space, the page will look better. When the elements gets too cramped and close to each other the page looks messy and it will be difficult to know what to focus on. Keep it simple, clean and get the product and buy button in focus.
    It's easier and saves time if you stick to a list of sizes like the one above, and then later change the values if needed.

3. Layout should compliment the idea of keeping it short and simple

    2 sections: Header and product description.
    The header should have product name, short description, 1 image and a read more button that links to the product desctiption below(use ID when linking). The header should fill the entire screen as well: `min-height: 100vh`.
    For the product description you can just google the shoe and copy the description, but keep it relatively short. We would prefer if this section is somewhat the same height as the header(100vh).
    The measurement `vh` means `Viewport Height` and `1vh` is `1%` of the viewport. You don't have to use vh, as long as the header fills the screen it's ok.

4. Button in focus

```
box-shadow: 0 10px 20px hsla(0,0%,0%,0.12), 0 3px 6px hsla(0,0%,0%,0.24);
text-transform: uppercase;
```

    We want people to notice the purchase button, and a nice way of doing so is using CAPS and shadow. In the code above I've used 2 sets of shadow because it looks more realistic(I'd recommend looking this stuff up in your preferred search engine).

5. Feedback

    I would love to see what you end up with, shoot me a mail at help@qexle.on.spiceworks.com, and if you do I will give you some pointers as to what looks good and where you can improve. This is really helpful to become better, not just for you but for me as well. Happy coding!
